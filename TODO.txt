~TODO~

---[Architecture]------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + COMPOSITE: Geometric types composed from simpler ones.
    - Composites must be able to be conveniently added on canvas along with their 
      components. Maybe add components only on a vector for picking and let the 
      composite object draw itself along with the components. 

 + LINK: Support the link of points so that they can be dragger together. 
    - Could be with the same instant of the linked object 
    - Or with multiple objects with some kind of soft link.

 + HOVER: Automatic hover on mouse move while btn down.

 + MEMORY:
    - Canvas should stop deleting 'vvr::Drawable' objects.
    - A resource management object should be designed.
    - Investigate the potential of using 'std::shared_ptr'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + TOOLS:
    - Create points in space.
    - Link set of points to form a higher-level entity. {Line, Triangle, Curve}.
