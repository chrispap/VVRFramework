[DATA]:
    - Canvas should stop deleting 'vvr::Drawable' objects! {NOT SAFE / NOT SCALABLE}
    - A resource management object should be designed.
    - Investigate the potential of using 'std::shared_ptr'.
    - A serialization process should be engineered.
    - A file format for storing/exporting/exchanging scenes should be introduced.

[TOOLS]:
    - Geometry creation.
    - Geometry manipulation.
    - Support smart interactions of shapes:
      - Snap, Align, Tangent, Equidistant, Parallel.
    - Make an editable queue of tools:

[APPS]:
    - Animation of iterative refinement of a Hilbert Curve.

[JSON]:
    - Sample:
        {
          "vvr::Point3D": [133,233,456],
          "vvr::Circle2D": {
            "center": [20,30],
            "radius": 50
          }
        }
